## ⏱️ Time Tracker Dashboard

A simple Next.js dashboard for tracking time across multiple projects, built to make timesheets less painful.  
Add timers, rename them by project, track active sessions, and visualize your work with a live chart.

## 💡 Why?

I built this tool because I was constantly juggling multiple projects and struggling to fill out my timesheet at work.
This widget helps me keep accurate track of where my time goes and makes reporting way easier.


## 🚀 Features

- Add multiple timers for different projects  
- Start, stop, reset, and delete timers  
- Rename timers to match project codes or names  
- Live pie chart showing time distribution across projects  
- Clean, responsive UI
